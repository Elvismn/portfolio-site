      <h2>Giving Back, Making a Difference</h2>
      <p>
        I believe that true leadership extends beyond personal goals—it thrives in service to others. 
        Through my community service experiences, I have learned the value of empathy, teamwork, and 
        creating opportunities for growth.

      <h2>Verified Volunteering: Elim Primary School</h2>
      <p>
        I had the privilege of volunteering at <strong>Elim Primary School</strong>, where I assisted in supporting 
        both staff and students. My contributions included mentoring learners, helping with classroom activities, 
        and providing guidance that fostered academic and personal growth.

      <h2>Peer Mentorship</h2>
      <p>
        As a peer mentor, I worked closely with fellow students to provide encouragement, 
        academic guidance, and personal support. This role taught me patience, active listening, 
        and the importance of being a role model to others.

      <h2>Lasting Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Community service has shaped me into a more responsible and empathetic leader. 
        The experience of giving back continues to inspire me to seek opportunities where 
        I can uplift others and contribute to building stronger, more connected communities.
